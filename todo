X create state of current piece
  - :piece :J
  - :position {:x 0 :y 0}

X add color
  - change write-piece to write the piece's keyword to the board cell
  - (for coloring/texturing per piece)

X repaint when relevant state changes
  - create (drawable-board) from current piece and board

X move piece
  - ignore if piece is nil
  - key listener modifies :position
  - create try-move!

X rotate piece
  - ignore if piece is nil
  - rename functions "collide" -> "fits", and "occupied" -> "empty"
  - create try-rotate!

X hard drop
  - get-drop-pos
  - debug by drawing the ghost piece

X gravity step
  - implement as go-routine
    - wait on blink
  - drop (lower position over time)
  - lock (write piece to board if can't go any lower)
  - spawn (reset current position and randomize piece)

X row collapse
  - get-full-rows (indices)
  - blink
  - collapse full rows

;;-----------------------------------------------------------------------
;; stats graph
;;-----------------------------------------------------------------------

- build live graph of the game
  - x-axis = piece number
  - y-axis = height of the board after piece was dropped
  - highlight rows that were collapsed
  - shade cells above to indicate:
    - a general sense of time it took to drop the piece
    - where the piece was hard-dropped

- important to make beautiful to beckon exploration

- treat the graph as a map to be navigated
  - mouse over a column to explain the data
    - column rotates to a front view of the board (eager to show)
      - revealing that the original column was in fact a side view of the board (aha)
    - piece animates to show where it was hard-dropped

;;-----------------------------------------------------------------------
;; multiplayer
;;-----------------------------------------------------------------------

- before game
  - show lobby

- during game
  - render all views (since we recieve all board states)
  - update layout order by scores

- after game
  - show everyone's stats graph

;; fixes
;;-----------------------------------------------------------------------

- Fix implementation inefficiencies:
  - make piece nil once we lock it into position
    - check if piece is nil on drawable board.
    - check if piece is nil on gravity routine.
  - hook requestAnimFrame to draw if relevant state differs from previous frame
    - remove draw from atom watcher (because multiple changes happen per frame)

- Fix control potential annoyances
  - nudge piece when rotating while flush with edge?
  - grant more time for t-spinning and general shifting?
    - reset gravity timeout when key is down
      - "fan" timeout and down key channels in gravity routine
        - if down key comes first, recur?
      - if at drop pos, also "fan" a global timeout to keep piece from shifting forever.

- Emotionally connect player to actions:
  - when piece is locked in, either...
    - body blink
    - border blink
    - shockwave border
  - when piece is hard-dropped:
    - show trail
  - when blocks collapse:
  - when piece enters:

- "Casino" sounds (don't clash when everyone's speakers are on)
